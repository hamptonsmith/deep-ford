Officially it’s closed for renovation, but they don’t usually post twenty-four-hour campus security to guard construction sites. Well, not since they finished the Sexual Magic Department’s new parking lot a few years ago. Some enterprising students who wanted to get the scoop, or just spend a spooky night camped out in a weird old building, might take it upon themselves to break in and investigate.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>There’s been a series of murders in a nearby Appalachian village and it’s starting to look like there may be a rogue werewolf making a nuisance of themselves. The g-persons are standing by, but because a single werewolf acting alone requires only a relatively routine intervention, Professor Netrin from the School of Containment Logistics has negotiated to have the government hang back while he organizes a work-study. Beyond a Maymester credit-hour and a solid line for a resume, student volunteers are entered into a raffle for a new Chromebook.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>A number of students just… aren’t… acting… right. They seem forgetful and listless, staring into space and muttering to themselves. Everybody has a class with one of these people, or knows one through a friend. Pair that with rumors of students who narrowly escaped attacks on campus late at night, and some folks might decide that a Student Action Committee is needed to do what the Administration will not.</p></blockquote></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside></main></body></html>
