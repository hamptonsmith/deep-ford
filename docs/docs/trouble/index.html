<blockquote>
<p>Nobody’s heard from Cayce Library since before last summer.  Officially it’s closed for renovation, but they don’t usually post twenty-four-hour campus security to guard construction sites.  Well, not since they finished the Sexual Magic Department’s new parking lot a few years ago.

<blockquote>
<p>There’s been a series of murders in a nearby Appalachian village and it’s starting to look like there may be a rogue werewolf making a nuisance of themselves.  The g-persons are standing by, but because a single werewolf acting alone requires only a relatively routine intervention, Professor Netrin from the School of Containment Logistics has negotiated to have the government hang back while he organizes a work-study.  Beyond a Maymester credit-hour and a solid line for a resume, student volunteers are entered into a raffle for a new Chromebook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now that the Star Essence Crystal Wand has been found and turned over to the administration, spaced-out students are fixed as fast as they&rsquo;re created, but Queen Void continues to ambush students at night in search of the Blood Space Countess&rsquo; hidden daughter.  The administration and the g-persons insist they&rsquo;re on top of it, but nobody has seen any concrete action.  A banned student group, Students Against The Void, is meeting in secret to coordinate countermeasures and those interested in space politics or ninja fights may find themselves swept up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Upsilon Phi Omega National Alien Coed Greek Organization is hosting a bake sale!  Proceeds will be given in pitiful and unworthy tribute to the Blood Space Countess, who&rsquo;s frankly pretty annoyed the brothers, sisters, and non-binary-en of U-Phi-O permitted Queen Void to infiltrate their organization.  Volunteers are needed to handle petty cash, donate tasty goods, and keep hovering g-persons and Royal Space Guards from killing each other during this time of heightened tension.</p>
