It’s a shadow war, after all. But some are eager to be good citizens and, hey, this is America and some Good Old Swamp Monster Families have Good Old Swamp Monster Money, so if you’re abnormal and young and idealistic, or maybe just connected or desperate, you might end up at Deep Ford College.</p><p>Nestled in the mountains of Virginia, to any outsider it’s a liberal arts college. But its true mission is as a front for the United States Government, teaching young abnormals to control their abilities and become productive members of society. For some that will ultimately mean quiet lives of research, for others it means being put to work as spies and assassins with powerful abilities, but in the moment, for most, it means flirting with the TA and trying to get through the semester with some O-Neg, raw meat, or ectoplasm left on their meal card.</p><p>Basically, if Scully, Mulder, Sam, Dean, Buffy, or Angel hunt it, you might find it knocking out its Gen Ed requirements at DFC.</p></article><footer class=book-footer><div class="flex flex-wrap justify-between"></div></footer><div class=book-comments></div><label for=menu-control class="hidden book-menu-overlay"></label></div><aside class=book-toc><nav id=TableOfContents></nav></aside></main></body></html>
