  <article class="markdown"><h1 id="quick-character-creation">Quick Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="required">Required</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Come up with two permanent <a href="https://hamptonsmith.github.io/deep-ford/docs/fate-for-dnd-players/#aspects">aspects</a>: a <em>high concept</em> and a <em>trouble</em>.</p>
<p>Your high concept should be a classic character archetype.  Since we’re at a supernatural college, those might be “<strong>vampire with a chip on her shoulder</strong>,” or “<strong>over-achieving warlock</strong>”.</p>
<p>Your trouble should be something that complicates your life.  “<strong>Pursued by circus folk</strong>,” “<strong>Only keeping it together with ritual magic</strong>”, and “<strong>Can’t say no to a pretty face</strong>” are examples.</p>
<p>The best concepts and troubles are double-edged and provide room for character intrigue.  :)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s all you need to do to come play your first session!  We can come up with the rest dynamically as we play.  But if you like twiddling stats:</p>
<h2 id="optional">Optional</h2>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>Assign <a href="https://hamptonsmith.github.io/deep-ford/docs/fate-for-dnd-players/#skills">skills</a>.  You get one +3 skill, two +2 skills, and three +1 skills.  We’re using the vanilla skills from Fate Core, which are: Athletics, Burglary, Contacts, Crafts, Deceive, Drive, Empathy, Fight, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Physique, Provoke, Rapport, Resources, Shoot, Stealth, and Will.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come up with three <em>stunts</em>.  A stunt is either a special ability or an exception to the rules just for you.  You can just come up with a general proposal and we’ll balance as we go.  Take extra stunts for a -1 <em>Refresh</em>.</p>
<p>Some general examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow a skill to do something it couldn’t normally do:
<ul>
<li>A mad scientist might be able to roll Crafts to make physical attacks in environments with lots of electrical or mechanical equipment on hand.</li>
<li>A siren might be able to roll Empathy to acquire material resources while in fluid social gatherings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Get a bonus in a particular situation:
<ul>
<li>A wizard might get a +2 to Lore when the subject matter is spells or magical theory.</li>
<li>A vampire might gain +2 to Athletics when perching, climbing, or balancing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Special abilities:
<ul>
<li>A werewolf might be able to fill any one consequence box to “wolf out” and gain +2 to Athletics, Fight, and Physique, and -2 to all others for an hour.</li>
<li>A firestarter might be able to spend a fate point to start a fire anywhere in the room equivalent to what they could do with a single match.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stunts that grant exceptions to the rules:
<ul>
<li>Once per combat, if you deal more than two hits and your opponent has a 2-point consequence box open, force them to use that consequence box rather than any available stress boxes.</li>
<li>Start each scene with a “free” invocation on one of your aspects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Come up with two weaknesses, which are just anti-stunts that represent your classic supernatural-creature lore.  Skip taking a weakness for -1 refresh each.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>A werewolf may be required to make a Empathy check when there’s blood in the air, with failure meaning they are forced to use their “wolf out” stunt.</li>
<li>A vampire may take a +2 physical attack against Physique every hour they are in direct sunlight.</li>
<li>A mad scientist may get a -2 to Will when trying to resist learning or building something.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
