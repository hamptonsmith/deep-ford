Since we’re at a supernatural college, those might be “vampire with a chip on her shoulder,” or “over-achieving warlock”.\nYour trouble should be something that complicates your life. “Pursued by circus folk,” “Only keeping it together with ritual magic”, and “Can’t say no to a pretty face” are examples.\nThe best concepts and troubles are double-edged and provide room for character intrigue. :)\n  That’s all you need to do to come play your first session! We can come up with the rest dynamically as we play. But if you like twiddling stats:\nOptional  Assign skills. You get one +3 skill, two +2 skills, and three +1 skills. We’re using the vanilla skills from Fate Core, which are: Athletics, Burglary, Contacts, Crafts, Deceive, Drive, Empathy, Fight, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Physique, Provoke, Rapport, Resources, Shoot, Stealth, and Will.\n  Come up with three stunts. A stunt is either a special ability or an exception to the rules just for you. You can just come up with a general proposal and we’ll balance as we go. Take extra stunts for a -1 Refresh.\nSome general examples are:\n Allow a skill to do something it couldn’t normally do:  A mad scientist might be able to roll Crafts to make physical attacks in environments with lots of electrical or mechanical equipment on hand. A siren might be able to roll Empathy to acquire material resources while in fluid social gatherings.   Get a bonus in a particular situation:  A wizard might get a +2 to Lore when the subject matter is spells or magical theory. A vampire might gain +2 to Athletics when perching, climbing, or balancing.   Special abilities:  A werewolf might be able to fill any one consequence box to “wolf out” and gain +2 to Athletics, Fight, and Physique, and -2 to all others for an hour. A firestarter might be able to spend a fate point to start a fire anywhere in the room equivalent to what they could do with a single match.   Stunts that grant exceptions to the rules:  Once per combat, if you deal more than two hits and your opponent has a 2-point consequence box open, force them to use that consequence box rather than any available stress boxes. Start each scene with a “free” invocation on one of your aspects.      Come up with two weaknesses, which are just anti-stunts that represent your classic supernatural-creature lore. Skip taking a weakness for -1 refresh each. For example:\n A werewolf may be required to make a Empathy check when there’s blood in the air, with failure meaning they are forced to use their “wolf out” stunt. A vampire may take a +2 physical attack against Physique every hour they are in direct sunlight. A mad scientist may get a -2 to Will when trying to resist learning or building something.

Officially it’s closed for renovation, but they don’t usually post twenty-four-hour campus security to guard construction sites. Well, not since they finished the Sexual Magic Department’s new parking lot a few years ago. Some enterprising students who wanted to get the scoop, or just spend a spooky night camped out in a weird old building, might take it upon themselves to break in and investigate.\n   There’s been a series of murders in a nearby Appalachian village and it’s starting to look like there may be a rogue werewolf making a nuisance of themselves. The g-persons are standing by, but because a single werewolf acting alone requires only a relatively routine intervention, Professor Netrin from the School of Containment Logistics has negotiated to have the government hang back while he organizes a work-study. Beyond a Maymester credit-hour and a solid line for a resume, student volunteers are entered into a raffle for a new Chromebook.\n   Now that the Star Essence Crystal Wand has been found and turned over to the administration, spaced-out students are fixed as fast as they\u0026rsquo;re created, but Queen Void continues to ambush students at night in search of the Blood Space Countess\u0026rsquo; hidden daughter. The administration and the g-persons insist they\u0026rsquo;re on top of it, but nobody has seen any concrete action. A banned student group, Students Against The Void, is meeting in secret to coordinate countermeasures and those interested in space politics or ninja fights may find themselves swept up.\n   Upsilon Phi Omega National Alien Coed Greek Organization is hosting a bake sale! Proceeds will be given in pitiful and unworthy tribute to the Blood Space Countess, who\u0026rsquo;s frankly pretty annoyed the brothers, sisters, and non-binary-en of U-Phi-O permitted Queen Void to infiltrate their organization. Volunteers are needed to handle petty cash, donate tasty goods, and keep hovering g-persons and Royal Space Guards from killing each other during this time of heightened tension.\n "});index.add({'id':4,'href':'/deep-ford/docs/fate-for-dnd-players/','title':"FATE for D\u0026D Players",'content':"FATE Cheatsheet for D\u0026amp;D Players The complete FATE Core rulebook is available here for pay-what-you-want.\nExample character sheet here.\nAspects An aspect is a short, publicly-established English phrase that describes a reality about a character, location, or situation. Aspects can be gained and lost. Some are permanent and some are temporary. “Can’t turn down a bet,” “Runs like a dream if you can get it into gear,” “Full of bats,” and “Weighed down by books” are examples of aspects.\nFate Points Fate points are the currency of the game. Your character starts each scene with at least as many points as their Refresh (but extras carry over from previous scenes). Most characters have a Refresh of 3, but during character creation you might choose a lower Refresh to buy some super fancy abilities. Up to you.\nDuring play, you spend fate points to:\n Define a scene detail. “I know the bartender here.” “I just so happen to have brought my trick cards.” Power a special ability (in game terms, a stunt) that requires a fate point (not all stunts do). Invoke some relevant aspect to modify a roll. “It should be harder for the goon to find me here in the warehouse since, as we’ve established, everything is on fire.” You can modify rolls in the following ways:  After seeing the result, add two to a roll (even somebody else’s) Reroll a roll (only your own) Add two points to the difficulty of some challenge   Compel another character to do something or have something happen to them due to an aspect. “I think John isn’t actually paying attention to the monitor because there are new people here and, as we’ve established, everybody wants to know him and visa versa.” Refuse somebody else’s attempt to compel your character (but you can’t refuse the game master!)  Skills Skills are your familiar point-driven metrics of character ability. For each point in a skill, you add one to rolls to check that skill. You roll with four Fate Dice, each of which has an even chance of showing a , a , or a . So, if you’ve got two points in Shoot and you roll , you’ve rolled a 3 for your Shoot Check (2 + 1 + 1 + 0 - 1).\nCombat When someone rolls a skill to attack you, you automatically get to roll a skill of your choice to try to defend. The difference in the attack and defense rolls is the number of hits the defender takes. To absorb hits you may:\n Fill an empty stress box. Stress boxes appear on your character card and each one has a numerical value. You can fill in an empty stress box to absorb as many hits as its numerical value, but extra absorption is wasted. Stress is a buffer against taking consequences. Accept a consequence in an empty consequence box. Consequences are temporary negative aspects. Consequence boxes appear on your character card and each has a numerical value. Adding a consequence absorbs as many hits as the box’s numerical value, but extra absorption is wasted.  Stress boxes regenerate after the conflict ends. Consequences take in-game time to resolve themselves. The higher the numerical value of the box, the longer it takes to resolve.\nA character who is unable to absorb all hits is taken out of the conflict.\n"});})();
