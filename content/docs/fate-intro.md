# FATE Cheatsheet for D&D Players 

The complete FATE Core rulebook is available [here](https://www.evilhat.com/home/fate-core-downloads/) for pay-what-you-want.

Example character sheet [here](https://online.anyflip.com/wltz/rxgh/files/mobile/1.jpg).

## Aspects
An _aspect_ is a short, publicly-established English phrase that describes a reality about a character, location, or situation.  Aspects can be gained and lost.  Some are permanent and some are temporary.  “**Can’t turn down a bet**,” “**Runs like a dream if you can get it into gear**,” “**Full of bats**,” and “**Weighed down by books**” are examples of aspects.

## Fate Points
_Fate points_ are the currency of the game.  Your character starts each scene with at least as many points as their _Refresh_ (but extras carry over from previous scenes).  Most characters have a Refresh of 3, but during character creation you might choose a lower Refresh to buy some super fancy abilities.  Up to you.

During play, you spend fate points to:

* Define a scene detail.  “I know the bartender here.”  “I just so happen to have brought my trick cards.”
* Power a special ability (in game terms, a _stunt_) that requires a fate point (not all stunts do).
* Invoke some relevant [aspect]({{< ref "#aspects" >}}) to modify a roll.  “It should be harder for the goon to find me here in the warehouse since, as we’ve established, **everything is on fire**.”  You can modify rolls in the following ways:
  * After seeing the result, add two to a roll (even somebody else’s)
  * Reroll a roll (only your own)
  * Add two points to the difficulty of some challenge
* Compel another character to do something or have something happen to them due to an aspect.  “I think John isn’t actually paying attention to the monitor because there are new people here and, as we’ve established, **everybody wants to know him and visa versa**.”
* Refuse somebody else’s attempt to compel your character (but you can’t refuse the game master!)

## Skills
_Skills_ are your familiar point-driven metrics of character ability.  For each point in a skill, you add one to rolls to check that skill.  You roll with four Fate Dice, each of which has an even chance of showing a {{< fplus >}}, a {{< fminus >}}, or a {{< fempty >}}.  So, if you’ve got two points in Shoot and you roll {{< fplus >}}{{< fplus >}}{{< fempty >}}{{< fminus >}}, you’ve rolled a 3 for your Shoot Check (2 + 1 + 1 + 0 - 1).

## Combat
When someone rolls a skill to attack you, you automatically get to roll a skill of your choice to try to defend.  The difference in the attack and defense rolls is the number of _hits_ the defender takes.  To absorb hits you may:
* Fill an empty _stress box_.  Stress boxes appear on your character card and each one has a numerical value.  You can fill in an empty stress box to absorb as many hits as its numerical value, but extra absorption is wasted.  Stress is a buffer against taking consequences.
* Accept a consequence in an empty _consequence box_.  Consequences are temporary negative [aspects]({{< ref "#aspects" >}}).  Consequence boxes appear on your character card and each has a numerical value.  Adding a consequence absorbs as many hits as the box’s numerical value, but extra absorption is wasted.

Stress boxes regenerate after the conflict ends.  Consequences take in-game time to resolve themselves.  The higher the numerical value of the box, the longer it takes to resolve.

A character who is unable to absorb all hits is _taken out_ of the conflict.
