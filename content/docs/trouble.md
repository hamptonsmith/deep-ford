# Some Trouble You Might Get Up To

> Nobody’s heard from Cayce Library since before last summer.  Officially it’s closed for renovation, but they don’t usually post twenty-four-hour campus security to guard construction sites.  Well, not since they finished the Sexual Magic Department’s new parking lot a few years ago.  Some enterprising students who wanted to get the scoop, or just spend a spooky night camped out in a weird old building, might take it upon themselves to break in and investigate.

> There’s been a series of murders in a nearby Appalachian village and it’s starting to look like there may be a rogue werewolf making a nuisance of themselves.  The g-persons are standing by, but because a single werewolf acting alone requires only a relatively routine intervention, Professor Netrin from the School of Containment Logistics has negotiated to have the government hang back while he organizes a work-study.  Beyond a Maymester credit-hour and a solid line for a resume, student volunteers are entered into a raffle for a new Chromebook.

> A number of students just… aren’t… acting… right.  They seem forgetful and listless, staring into space and muttering to themselves.  Everybody has a class with one of these people, or knows one through a friend.  Pair that with rumors of students who narrowly escaped attacks on campus late at night, and some folks might decide that a Student Action Committee is needed to do what the Administration will not.
