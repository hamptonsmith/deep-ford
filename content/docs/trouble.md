# Some Trouble You Might Get Up To

> Nobody’s heard from Cayce Library since before last summer.  Officially it’s closed for renovation, but they don’t usually post twenty-four-hour campus security to guard construction sites.  Well, not since they finished the Sexual Magic Department’s new parking lot a few years ago.  Some enterprising students who wanted to get the scoop, or just spend a spooky night camped out in a weird old building, might take it upon themselves to break in and investigate.

> What was supposed to be a werewolf hunt instead erased Morton, NC.  It's good that the murders stopped or whatever, but the question remains what exactly the cultists were up to.  Professor Netrin and Ethan Craig have established a joint research project with Meg Owen's lab in the Department of Arcana to study some of the paraphernalia recovered from their shrine.  Student researchers are needed to translate texts, catalog stone icons, and keep the artifacts... calm.  Those with shellfish allergies or a fear of boundless otherworldly vistas need not apply.  Experience cleaning cat hair out of human organs strongly preferred.

> Now that the Star Essence Crystal Wand has been found and turned over to the administration, spaced-out students are fixed as fast as they're created, but Queen Void continues to ambush students at night in search of the Blood Space Countess' hidden daughter.  The administration and the g-persons insist they're on top of it, but nobody has seen any concrete action.  A banned student group, Students Against The Void, is meeting in secret to coordinate countermeasures and those interested in space politics or ninja fights may find themselves swept up.

> Upsilon Phi Omega National Alien Coed Greek Organization is hosting a bake sale!  Proceeds will be given in pitiful and unworthy tribute to the Blood Space Countess, who's frankly pretty annoyed the brothers, sisters, and non-binary-en of U-Phi-O permitted Queen Void to infiltrate their organization.  Volunteers are needed to handle petty cash, donate tasty goods, and keep hovering g-persons and Royal Space Guards from killing each other during this time of heightened tension.
