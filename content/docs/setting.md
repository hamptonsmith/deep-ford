# Setting

Vampires are real, of course.  And ghosts and psychics and aliens.  Those oddity shops supposedly built on ley lines where water runs uphill and two-headed cows are in jars?  Ok, those aren’t real.  But the ley lines are.  And the owners probably do know someone with two heads.

But the earth is for the normals.  Can’t have panic in the streets.  And like most countries, America crawls from sea to shining sea with hunters, Pinkertons, and g-persons who harass and persecute the monsters to stay under the bed and keep the magical violence to a minimum.

Most abnormals who can’t stay off the radar just go and get disappeared, discreetly and bloodily (or slimily, depending on the particulars of the anatomy of the abnormal in question).  It’s a shadow war, after all.  But some are eager to be good citizens and, hey, this is America and some Good Old Swamp Monster Families have Good Old Swamp Monster Money, so if you’re abnormal and young and idealistic, or maybe just connected or desperate, you might end up at Deep Ford College.

Nestled in the mountains of Virginia, to any outsider it’s a liberal arts college.  But its true mission is as a front for the United States Government, teaching young abnormals to control their abilities and become productive members of society.  For some that will ultimately mean quiet lives of research, for others it may mean being put to work as spies and assassins with powerful abilities, but in the moment, for most, it means flirting with the TA and trying to get through the semester with some O-Neg, raw meat, or ectoplasm left on their meal card.

Basically, if Scully, Mulder, Sam, Dean, Buffy, or Angel hunt it, you might find it knocking out its Gen Ed requirements at DFC.
