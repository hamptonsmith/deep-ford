# Quick Character Creation

## Required

1) Come up with two permanent [aspects]({{< ref "fate-intro#aspects" >}}): a _high concept_ and a _trouble_.

   Your high concept should be a classic character archetype.  Since we’re at a supernatural college, those might be “**vampire with a chip on her shoulder**,” or “**over-achieving warlock**”.

   Your trouble should be something that complicates your life.  “**Pursued by circus folk**,” “**Only keeping it together with ritual magic**”, and “**Can’t say no to a pretty face**” are examples.

   The best concepts and troubles are double-edged and provide room for character intrigue.  :)

That’s all you need to do to come play your first session!  We can come up with the rest dynamically as we play.  But if you like twiddling stats:

## Optional

2) Assign [skills]({{< ref "fate-intro#skills" >}}).  You get one +3 skill, two +2 skills, and three +1 skills.  We’re using the vanilla skills from Fate Core, which are: Athletics, Burglary, Contacts, Crafts, Deceive, Drive, Empathy, Fight, Investigate, Lore, Notice, Physique, Provoke, Rapport, Resources, Shoot, Stealth, and Will.

3) Come up with three _stunts_.  A stunt is either a special ability or an exception to the rules just for you.  You can just come up with a general proposal and we’ll balance as we go.  Take extra stunts for a -1 _Refresh_.

   Some general examples are:
   
   * Allow a skill to do something it couldn’t normally do:
     * A mad scientist might be able to roll Crafts to make physical attacks in environments with lots of electrical or mechanical equipment on hand.
     * A siren might be able to roll Empathy to acquire material resources while in fluid social gatherings.
   * Get a bonus in a particular situation:
     * A wizard might get a +2 to Lore when the subject matter is spells or magical theory.
     * A vampire might gain +2 to Athletics when perching, climbing, or balancing.
   * Special abilities:
     * A werewolf might be able to fill any one consequence box to “wolf out” and gain +2 to Athletics, Fight, and Physique, and -2 to all others for an hour.
     * A firestarter might be able to spend a fate point to start a fire anywhere in the room equivalent to what they could do with a single match.
   * Stunts that grant exceptions to the rules:
     * Once per combat, if you deal more than two hits and your opponent has a 2-point consequence box open, force them to use that consequence box rather than any available stress boxes.
     * Start each scene with a “free” invocation on one of your aspects.

4) Come up with two weaknesses, which are just anti-stunts that represent your classic supernatural-creature lore.  Skip taking a weakness for -1 refresh each.  For example:
   * A werewolf may be required to make a Empathy check when there’s blood in the air, with failure meaning they are forced to use their “wolf out” stunt.
   * A vampire may take a +2 physical attack against Physique every hour they are in direct sunlight.
   * A mad scientist may get a -2 to Will when trying to resist learning or building something.
